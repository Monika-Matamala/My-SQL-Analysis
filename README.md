# My-SQL-Analysis
# Pizza Sales Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves performing a comprehensive sales analysis of a pizza restaurant using MySQL. The analysis includes retrieving key metrics, identifying trends, and deriving insights about order patterns, revenue, and pizza preferences.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
1. **Retrieve the total number of orders placed** to understand order volume.
2. **Calculate the total revenue generated** from pizza sales.
3. **Identify the most common pizza size ordered** to determine customer preferences.
4. **List the top 5 most ordered pizza types** and their quantities.
5. **Find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered** using table joins.
6. **Analyze the distribution of orders by hour of the day** to identify peak order times.
7. **Group orders by date** and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
8. **Identify the top 3 most ordered pizza types by revenue**.
9. **Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type** to the total revenue.
10. **Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time** to observe revenue trends.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Database Management System:** MySQL
- **Query Language:** SQL
- **Data Source:** Structured database containing pizza sales, orders, and details

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this analysis contains the following tables:
1. **Orders Table:** Contains information about the orders placed, including order ID, timestamps, and total amounts.
2. **Order Details Table:** Includes details about each order, such as pizza type, size, quantity, and price.
3. **Pizza Table:** Provides information about different pizzas, their categories, and prices.


## Insights Derived
1. **Order Volume**: Understanding how many total orders were placed gives insight into the overall business activity.
2. **Revenue Trends**: Identifying the total revenue and revenue trends over time helps assess business performance.
3. **Pizza Size Preferences**: Knowing the most popular pizza size helps tailor product offerings to customer demand.
4. **Top Pizza Types**: Highlighting the top 5 most ordered pizza types provides insight into customer preferences.
5. **Peak Hours**: Analyzing order distribution by hour helps determine peak hours for orders.
6. **Category Analysis**: Grouping pizzas by category identifies the most popular categories.
7. **Revenue Contribution**: Calculating revenue contribution by pizza type aids in understanding high-performing products.

## Conclusion
This project successfully analyzed the sales data of a pizza restaurant using MySQL, revealing important insights about orders, revenue, and customer preferences. The findings can help the business make data-driven decisions to improve operations, optimize product offerings, and maximize revenue.

## Future Scope
- Automate the analysis using Python and integrate visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Tableau.
- Add more granular time-series analysis to predict future sales trends.
- Analyze customer demographics to understand order behavior better.
